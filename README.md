# chip8-emu-cpp
> CHIP-8 Emulator written in C++ (interpreted)

## Building the emulator
* `make`

## Running the emulator
* `./chip8 <path-to-ROM-file>`

### Keyboard mappings
* This is the original keypad of the CHIP-8 VM

```
 1 2 3 C 
 4 5 6 D 
 7 8 9 E 
 A 0 B F 
```

* In this emulator, these are mapped to these keys on a keyboard

```
 1 2 3 4 
 Q W E R 
 A S D F 
 Z X C V 
```

### Notes
* I have yet to find the original controls of the games. For now, you must play using trial and error to find the correct keys. I'll research on this when I have the time.
